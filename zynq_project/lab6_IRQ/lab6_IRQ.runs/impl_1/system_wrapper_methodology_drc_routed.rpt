2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CKLD-1#1 Warning
Clock Net has non-BUF driver and too many loads  
Clock net system_i/processing_system7_0/inst/FCLK_CLK0 is not driven by a Clock Buffer and has more than 512 loads. Driver(s): system_i/processing_system7_0/inst/PS7_i/FCLKCLK[0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.635 ns between system_i/ps7_0_axi_periph/m04_couplers/auto_pc/inst/gen_axilite.gen_b2s_conv.axilite_b2s/SI_REG/aw.aw_pipe/m_payload_i_reg[39]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and system_i/ps7_0_axi_periph/m04_couplers/auto_pc/inst/gen_axilite.gen_b2s_conv.axilite_b2s/WR.aw_channel_0/cmd_translator_0/s_axburst_eq1_reg/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.684 ns between system_i/ps7_0_axi_periph/m04_couplers/auto_pc/inst/gen_axilite.gen_b2s_conv.axilite_b2s/SI_REG/aw.aw_pipe/m_payload_i_reg[39]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and system_i/ps7_0_axi_periph/m04_couplers/auto_pc/inst/gen_axilite.gen_b2s_conv.axilite_b2s/WR.aw_channel_0/cmd_translator_0/s_axburst_eq0_reg/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on buttons_tri_i[1] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on buttons_tri_i[2] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on buttons_tri_i[3] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on switches_tri_i[0] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on switches_tri_i[2] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#8 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on switches_tri_i[3] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>
